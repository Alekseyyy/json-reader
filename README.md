# Simple JSON reader

This is a simple JSON reading desktop app that I programmed for two reasons:

1. To take JSON files on my computer and put them into an easier to digest format. 
2. To learn a bit of UI design and PyQt5 and use this as a reference.

It should be noted that there are websites that read JSON files, but I don't feel comfortable them to their webservers. And so, this project was born. I relied on tutorials written by [Ramos (n.d.)](https://realpython.com/qt-designer-python/), [Varun (n.d.)](https://thispointer.com/python-iterate-loop-over-all-nested-dictionary-values/) and [Tutorials Point (n.d.)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pyqt/pyqt_qfiledialog_widget.htm), and (might) use icons from [icons8.com (n.d.)](https://icons8.com/icon/set/user-interface/glyph-neue) to build this app.
